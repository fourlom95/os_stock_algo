# os_stock_algo
A Repository of Open Source Algorithms for Stock Trading

Notes:

The Project requires access to a Stock Broker account with an API to Pull Data and Open/Close Trades.
The API Parts of the Code are marked ##API 
For Demo Purposes I am using IG Markets Stock Broker account to Pull Data and Open/Close Trades as their API also works for a Demo Account. (You will still have to open a regular account first in Order to get a Demo Account)

The Project also requires a Google Cloud workspace. Specific Instructions to setup the Cloud Space and the code for the functions etc are found in the GCS Folder.
